# TODO

- Pressing enter in a text field should play a random from remaining categories or files
- Update all 'hi' categories to 'hello'
- Play with keeping UI always active to incorporate better features:
  - It takes a few seconds to load since it has to read the file list each time.
  - Incorporate tracking of sound files already played in a particular category to prevent duplicate sounds
